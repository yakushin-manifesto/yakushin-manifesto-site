### Shocking Facts

1. **1870**: **84%** of the world's technical books were monopolized by just four languages
   - üá¨üáß English, üá´üá∑ French, üá©üá™ German, üáÆüáπ Italian
   - Other countries were effectively cut off from access to the latest technology

2. **The Japanese government's revolutionary response**:
   - Launched a large-scale emergency translation project
   - Goal: Translate Western knowledge into Japanese and disseminate it to the entire population

3. **Astounding results**:
   - **In just 17 years**, the number of technical books in üáØüáµ Japanese reached the same level as üá©üá™ Germany in 1870
   - In terms of technical knowledge, Japan rapidly caught up with the world's advanced nations

> These research findings clearly demonstrate Japan's potential for technological innovation and economic growth.
> 
> The time has come to learn from history and embark on a new challenge.

## Remarkable Achievements

The changes brought about by this knowledge revolution in Japan were dramatic.

| Year | Percentage of Manufactured Goods in Exports |
|---:|:-------------------:|
| 1868 | Less than 30% |
| 1885 | 20% |
| 1895 | 60% |

Furthermore, **between 1885 and 1899**:
- Japan's labor productivity growth rate: **2.7% annual average**
- This was **more than double** the per capita GDP growth rate during the same period!
