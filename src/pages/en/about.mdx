My name is G端nther Brunner. As the founder of this manifesto, I've leveraged my global perspective and extensive experience in Japan to launch this project. While this manifesto originated from my vision, I expect it to evolve independently and be shaped by the contributions of many.

In 2007, I came to Japan as a MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) scholarship student. Later, I was recognized as a highly skilled professional. This experience laid the foundation for my deep understanding of Japan's educational system and social structure.

A turning point in my career was joining CyberAgent, where I engaged in cutting-edge technology development. Currently, I'm leading productivity improvement and technological innovation in the CTO's office. Simultaneously, I have over 15 years of experience as a professional translator, addressing international business challenges from both technical and linguistic perspectives.

By combining technical expertise with international experience, I strive to be a bridge between Japan and the global market, promoting innovation and cultural exchange. Through this manifesto, I aim to work with you all towards realizing a new economic revolution in Japan.
